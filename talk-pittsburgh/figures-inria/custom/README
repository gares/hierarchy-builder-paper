About the "tabs"
****************

For technical reason, we couldn't have the "tab" with a transparent background instead of the white background.
So I (Yohan) reproduced it from the svg furnished by the "comm" service.

Warning: there is still an issue with our approach.
"flou" (blur) filter seems not to handled correctly by pdf1-4 or eps3.0.
So we need to adjust zoom the .svg and then export it with rasterization.

NB1: All svg files are inkscape svg files.

How it was build
****************

 tab (bottom and upper)
 ======================

 Reference: 110616_inria_charte_identitaire.pdf p.47 and p.49 
            with y=11.233px x=19px 
 Tweak    : blur at 70% instead of 30%

 - the blur do not follow the "chartre" for now
 - blur = black, opacity 70%, blur 6.5 
 
 Rationale 1: for the blur we choose an opacity of 70% instead of the official blur of 30%,
 since export to pdf/eps from inkscape whiten the blur.

 banner bottom
 =============

 Reference: 110616_inria_charte_identitaire.pdf p.15
            + powerpoint template for the sizes.
 Tweak    : opacity set to 90%

 How to   :
 - powerpoint model was open with open-office and exported to pdf
 - pdf, was imported with inkscape, with maximal resolution
 - banner was copied & merge with the tabBottom
 - the box was drawed 'in transparent black"
 - construction figures were removed, and size adjusted
 - the figure was then imported on the background svg (see below)
 - resized to fit the beamer page, and same color gradient was applied.
 - background was deleted, and page was resized to fit the banner.

 Tweak    : opacity set to 90%

 How to   :
 - use the beamer page in inkscape
 - colors: use the one in the reference 
 - opacity was adjusted to 90% since colors seemed too bright.
