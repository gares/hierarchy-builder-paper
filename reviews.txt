----- TEXT:
This paper describes the language HB, for Hierarhy Builder, that is
implemented as an add-on to Coq, and allows to design and evolve
algebraic hierarchies inside a proof assistant. It supports multiple
inheritance, and hierarchy evolution without breakage of user code. A
mathematical description of the language is given, along with a
description of the Elpi-based implementation, which compiles pieces of
hierarchy description mixed with Coq code into canonical structures
following the (flat) packed class discipline popularized by the
mathematical components library.

I believe this paper makes two contributions. The first one,
surprisingly little advertised, is providing a way for normal Coq
users to write hierarchies using the packed class discipline. While
this discipline is recognized as the most robust way to write such
hierarchies in Coq, in terms of stability and performance, it is also,
as the authors put it, unwieldly to write without assistance.  The
other one is a language design which allows to smoothly accomodate
multiple inheritance and hierarchy evolution, and could be of interest
to other theorem provers too.

My assessment is that while the first contribution is easy to see
through the examples provided, the second one is much harder to
follow, as the explanations and formal definitions are not as helpful
as one could expect. I do agree that hierarchy evolution is an
important design goal, and it seems it has been achieved, but the
technical details are hard to follow.

Despite these shortcomings of presentation, I would still argue for
acceptance, be it as a system description, as the tool is invaluable,
and it is reasonably well described.

Other comments to authors:

p1, line 41-42,45:
  You use citations as object, which is hard to read, especially if
  they are just numbers.

=DONE= Change "in [13]" with "by Someone [13]"

p3, line 102, 107, 142, ...
  hb.canonical seems to be hb.instance in the code.
  There are a few occurrences of that.

=DONE= Replace "hb.canonical" page 3 with "HB.instance"

p4, line 122: addrN -> addNr

=DONE= "but rather a theorem of the122abstract theory of Abelian groups
   proved at line XX"

p4-5, evolution of the hierarchy:
  Could you make clearer the distinction (or absence of) between
  axioms and theorems in your implementation of a theory (problem
  mentioned on line 121). I.e., does it matter or not for the user of
  the hierarchy.

=DONE= insert between 2.1 and 2.2 some text inspired by
    There are two distinct use cases for a hierarchy:
    1. one assumes a structure as
        an hypothesis. In this case, all its axioms are theorems so the distinction
        axiom-theorem does not matter.
    2. one instantiates a structure on a concrete
        type in order to access all its theory. Here, however, one must pick an
        axiomatic (i.e. a set of axioms) to show Coq that some type is indeed an
        instance of a structure. If for each structure there is only one axiomatic
        (which is its internal representation) and if we keep changing it, some theorems
        may become axioms and increase the burden on the user (this is what happens with
        addrC in V2, in order to instantiate a ring one has to prove it, while it was
        not required in V1). We fix that by letting the designer provide as many
        axiomatics as she wants, so that the user can pick the most convenient one, in
        particular V3 also provides the axiomatic from V1 as a factory. Behind the
        scenes, hierarchy-builder compiles it to the axiomatic currently used as the
        internal representation (made of mixins).

p5, factory code and explanation:
  I had a very hard time connecting the figure, the explanations, and
  the code. Actually, while I roughly understand what the code is
  supposed to do, I still do not understand what is shown in
  Figure 1.

=DONE= edit the figure and add the names of structures and builders

Section 3:
  The semi-mathematical definitions you introduce are hard to read,
  and do not replace proper explanations. Couldn't you use grammars or
  a form of typing/deduction rules?

=CC= ?

   RecordDecl ::= "Record" Name "(" Name{0} ":" Term ")" Factory*
   Factory ::= "(" Name{1} ":" Name{2} Name{0} Name{1}* ")"
   Name{2} is a mixin

p7, line 196: which -> whose

=CC= fix

line 198: "an additional argument f, which we call a factory"
  f returns a type, how can it be itself an argument?
  Do you mean an argument of type f?
  Couldn't you just say that a builder is a function that builds a
  mixin from other mixins, rather than just describe its type.

=CC= clarify, the return type is not the one of f but the one of \mu
=CC= "an additional argument (of type) f"
=CC= turn definition 6 into 3 definitions

line 209:
  Why include properties in the definition?
  In particular property (3) is trivial, as it is exactly the
  definition of provides.

=CC= clarify what "is defined" means (recall from is a relation, not
   necessarily a total one)

Propositions 5 and 8: there is no proof, but is there anything to
prove?

=CC= rework as follows

  Proposition 5) dep represents a transitively closed DAG, in particular
    dep*(dep*(M)) ⊆ dep*(M).
  Proof.
  dep is transitively closed since records are well typed in the empty context.
  dep describes a DAG since Coq does not admit circular definitions.
  Qed.

  Proposition 8) There is a way to see mixins as factories (M ⊆  F).
  Proof.
  For each m ∈ M we pose
  * requires(m) = dep(m)
  * provides(m) = {m}
  * from (m, m) = fun T (p : m T p σ ) (x : m T p 1 . . . p n ) => x ∈ B
  Qed.

Section 4:
  What are you describing here?
  Is it the code your tool generate?
  Does it correspond (exactly) to examples in Section 2?
  Has anything been omitted?

=DONE= clarify at the beginning of section 4
  Section 4.1 shows Coq code that is equivalent to the HB commands given in
  Section 2. These commands do not synthesize that text, but have the same effect.

  Many details were omitted:
  * the abbreviations mentioned in section 3.3
  * the declarations of canonical structures are postponed to 4.3
  * "Exported" notions are gathered into an inner module, eg Monoid.Exports.

p10, line 301: semiringsas

=DONE= fix

Section 5:
  Elpi code is hard to read for beginners.
  An essential aspect is HOAS, which could be described in more detail. 

== see next

p13, line 383:
  Where and how does binder mobility occur in the code that follows?
  Apparently on line 11, but there is no explanation of why this amounts to
  binder mobility.

=ET= if we run out of space cut at "In this timple case...."
   add a sentence saying that HOAS helps, => as well

p14, line 415: "super set" -> superset
line 416: provides -> provide

=DONE= fix

Section 6:
  It could be interesting to contrast the approach of packed classes with
  type classes or inheritance on object oriented languages.
  In particular, the fact tha, while any type has access to the
  functions/lemmas defined on types it can be coerced to, the
  functions/lemmas are themselves defined on individual types, means that
  their names are handled in a nominal (i.e. two distinct lemmas may have
  the same name, without problems of coherence).
  (This is not a requirement for this paper, just if you want to analyse
  more the power of HB)

----- TEXT:
The paper describes Hierarchy Builder, an embedded language for defining
algebraic structures in Coq. The main benefits of the language are

- getting rid of tedious and error-prone boiler plate, abstracting away from
  the low-level technical details of Coq, and
- providing a robust mechanism for evolving a library without breaking user code

The paper addresses an important problem in formal mathematics and the proposed
solution looks promising and is well presented. The only thing missing is a
larger case study. At the very least I would like to see a paragraph or two
about the status of applying Hierarchy Builder to some real examples, like the
Mathematical Components library. How much can you do (or have done) already
now, and what requires extensions of HB (like the parameterisation over
structures you mention in the conclusions).

Overall I recommend this paper for publication.

## Summary

In formalization of mathematics with proof assistants, an important engineering question is how to organize hierarchies of mathematical structures. Sometimes there are multiple ways that a hierarchy could be organized, none of which is the best. As a large library develops, it is difficult to change the overall structure of its hierarchy of structures, which may lead to problems.

In this paper the authors describe a specialized language HB whose purpose is to build and evolve such structures. The language HB works on top of Coq, and its implementation uses another specialized language, Elpi, which also interfaces with Coq. The end result is a hierarchy of Coq type classes that a user can then refer to in their development.

## Assessment

The machinery is impressive, at times a bit intimidating. I can imagine a few experts using these tools to build hierarchies, but I would not expect the average Coq user to invest time into learning about them. For instance, I would be worried about having several extra tools that my own development relies on, especially if they're of "academic quality". We should therefore understand the present paper as an exploration of design space, rather than a presentation of a finished tool that should be used "in production" (by people who are not the authors of the tool).

On the other hand, I do not wish to underestimate the importance of having flexible ways of managing hierarchies of mathematical structures in a proof assistant. Past experience has taught us that design mistakes in the libraries can be quite costly, and that it is important to have the ability to adapt and modify the hierarchies.
